			Hi! I'm <strong>Truong Vo</strong> aka <strong>OssiLV</strong> â€” a DevOps fresher from Vietnam ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³ passionate about automation, cloud infrastructure, and all things DevOps. This blog is where I document my journey into the world of DevOps, cloud computing, and continuous delivery. It's not just a place to showcase what Iâ€™ve learned, but also a space where I reflect, experiment, and grow.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
			I believe in <strong>learning by doing</strong>, so most of my posts are rooted in hands-on experienceâ€”from setting up CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions, to provisioning infrastructure on AWS using Terraform and Ansible. I'm actively building real-world projects that simulate actual industry scenarios, and I write about the lessons, mistakes, and successes along the way.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
			My goal with this blog is two-fold: <strong>to strengthen my own understanding by teaching others</strong>, and to provide useful, beginner-friendly resources for fellow DevOps learners who are just starting out. I know how overwhelming the world of DevOps can seem at firstâ€”so I aim to break things down simply and clearly.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
			Expect to find content about Linux commands and shell scripting, cloud best practices, Docker-based deployments, Infrastructure as Code, monitoring, security basics, and more. I'm also sharing learning roadmaps, interview prep, and career advice for those aspiring to land their first DevOps role.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
			If you're a DevOps learner like me, I hope you'll find something here that helps you take the next step. Letâ€™s learn, build, automateâ€”and growâ€”together.
